# MNIST Digit Classification

This project demonstrates how to build and train a machine learning model for digit classification using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used dataset in machine learning research, consisting of images of handwritten digits (0-9) and their corresponding labels. The project uses a built-in library to load the MNIST dataset and train a model for digit classification.

## Introduction

The MNIST digit classification task involves training a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of which is a grayscale image of a digit from 0 to 9.

## Features

- Uses a built-in library to load the MNIST dataset.
- Builds and trains a model for digit classification.
- Evaluates the model's performance on the test dataset.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Clone the project repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    - Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended).
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Install the required Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
    - Run the script to train the model on the MNIST dataset and evaluate its performance.
    ```bash
    python mnist_classification.py
    ```

## Data

- The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing).
- Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image of a digit from 0 to 9.

## Model Architecture

- The project may use different types of machine learning models such as:
    - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Effective for image classification tasks.
    - **Dense Neural Networks**: Simple neural networks with dense layers.
- Choose the model architecture that best suits the task and available data.

## Code Explanation

- **mnist_classification.py**:
    - The main script for loading the MNIST dataset, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
    - Uses built-in library functions to load the dataset and preprocess the data.
    - Trains the model using the training data and evaluates it using the test data.
    - Displays the accuracy and other performance metrics of the model.
